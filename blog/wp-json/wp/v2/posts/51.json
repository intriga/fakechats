For one thing, its inventor, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/iep.utm.edu\/pascal-b\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mathematician Blaise Pascal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, wasn\u2019t setting out to create a game at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most famous scientists of his time, Pascal was actually trying to invent a perpetual motion machine, or a machine that functions without having an energy source. You can kind of see why Pascal thought the roulette wheel might work \u2014 it\u2019s quite hypnotic when it spins \u2014 but ultimately, it turned out to just be a motion machine.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully, Pascal didn\u2019t feel too bad that his experiment failed. For one thing, scientists say that, under the laws of physics, a perpetual motion machine can\u2019t exist, so the odds were stacked against him. Second, he inadvertently invented the roulette wheel. Quite the legacy to have!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>It\u2019s First Casino Use Was in Europe<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The roulette wheel didn\u2019t immediately go from &#8216;failed science experiment\u2019 to \u2018mainstay casino fixture.\u2019 It needed some time before people saw the gaming potential of the device. There are no records of when the first prototypes of the machine appeared in Europe\u2019s casinos, but it was certainly in use in Paris by 1796.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, the machine began to spread outward across Europe. It was in Monaco, in the 1840s, that the roulette wheel got a significant update when King Charles III added a single zero. From there, number variations began to become more common, especially following the arrival of the roulette wheel in the United States in the mid-1800s.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Wheels Can Have Different Numbers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All roulette wheels look similar from afar, but take a closer look and you may well notice a few differences, depending on where you\u2019re from and where you\u2019re playing. Thus,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pokerstars.uk\/casino\/news\/roulette-numbers-how-do-they-work\/819\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">roulette numbers vary depending on location<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so much so that in\u00a0the United States, there are 38 numbers on the wheel (1 &#8211; 36, 0, and 00) and in Europe, a roulette wheel has 37 numbers (1 &#8211; 36, 0).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you manage to find an American wheel from yesteryear, you\u2019ll find even more variations. The earliest models had numbers 1 &#8211; 28, 0, 00, and a slot with an image of an American Eagle \u2014 though, unlike the general positive connotations of the American eagle, players would hope it wouldn\u2019t land there since it meant the house won.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-53 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-300x200.avif\" alt=\"Wheels Can Have Different Numbers\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-300x200.avif 300w, https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-1024x683.avif 1024w, https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-768x513.avif 768w, https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-1536x1025.avif 1536w, https:\/\/fakedetail.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/image-2-fake-2048x1367.avif 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>How Roulette Wheels Work?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do roulette wheels work, exactly? We\u2019re not going to explain the science behind the motion &#8211; not because we don\u2019t want to, but because we can\u2019t. Instead, let\u2019s focus on the nuts and bolts of the machine itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wheel, which we\u2019re sure you can picture, needs to have an even weight distribution in order to be legitimate. Each number on the wheel should be evenly spaced. Neither the wheel nor the ball should be made of magnetic materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve got all those things ticked, you\u2019ve got yourself a roulette wheel. Of course, it works differently at online casinos, where it\u2019s an algorithm that dictates the outcome. These places tend to use RNGs (Random Number Generators) to ensure fair play.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Final Thoughts<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The roulette wheel began its life as an experiment before taking on the world. Even more than 350 years after its invention, it continues to delight \u2014 and likely will for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 350 years.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The roulette wheel is about as iconic as it gets.
