Bookies are a common target for hackers. Why? Well, we are talking about a multi-billion-dollar industry where they can exploit sensitive information that will give them some kind of monetary advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say that you are a bookmaker, your sportsbook is working smoothly, bets are rolling in and your profit margins are high. Then, bam &#8211; a cyberattack hits, your customer data\u2019s leaked, and your reputation is sinking in the blink of an eye.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A total nightmare scenario.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybercriminals are like circling charts, and since bookies handle a goldmine of sensitive data like credit cards, addresses, and betting histories, they are a common target.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, in theory, a single hack on a bookie can ruin the company forever, leading to bankruptcy, even if it is a small one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But is there a solution? Well, nothing can stop cybercrime, and experts even suggest that it will continue rising in the future. The only thing that bookies can do is invest in new technologies that will help them get one step ahead of cybercriminals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s dive deeper into cyberattacks on bookies and find out the solution to this problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Bookies Are Hacker Bait?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, it is kind of obvious. Bookies for hackers are just like hitting the jackpot. Every bettor is required to make a profile, adding their name, email, bank details, and even uploading sensitive documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that they hold very valuable data that hackers can exploit. They can steal identities, credit card information, and even target specific accounts to get their betting money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global average cost of a data breach in 2024 was $4.88 million, up 10% from 2023, according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/reports\/data-breach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IBM\u2019s Cost of a Data Breach Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and shocking this does not include the PR nightmare and the costs of customers lost in the process, which may be the most devastating hit for bookies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, breaches can hit harder, and we\u2019ve had plenty of ransomware attacks, where they lock the system until a ransom is paid. This might not be a big problem for bookies but dealing with unethical hackers who cannot be trustworthy puts them in a very sensitive position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some hackers are also not in for the data. They want to get access to the bookie&#8217;s system just to manipulate odds, rig bets, or crash apps during peak events like the Super Bowl, costing them millions of dollars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, the hackers that target such organizations aren\u2019t your average nerds with a hoodie and a laptop sitting in the nearby cafe, but sophisticated gangs that use AI and other strategies to exploit weak links in the software.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fraud Prevention<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not many people know that cybersecurity also tackles fraud. This is a massive headache for bookies since they are dealing with such things every day. The UK Gambling Commission\u2019s 2024 guidance flags fraud as a top issue, which is why they require bookies to verify identities via third-party tools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, AI can help bookies detect fraudulent activities. AI can flag suspicious patterns like 50 accounts from one IP address, and other things that the human eye could miss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But hackers are getting more creative and sneakier. They use stolen credentials to hijack accounts where they drain their balances faster than you can enter your password. So, you are excited to make a horse racing bet, and you are browsing the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twinspires.com\/belmont-stakes\/winners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Belmont Stakes winners list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just to see your balance at 0.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why most bookies now have multi-factor authentication addons, which cut down brute force attacks by 99%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will always be fraud in the world of online betting, but the good thing is that most of the fraud is for gaining personal advantage and doesn\u2019t jeopardize the reputation of the bookie and doesn\u2019t put the funds of the other customers at risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cybersecurity also tackles fraud, a massive headache for bookies. Fraudsters open multiple\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regulatory Compliance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also have regulators in the process, who aren\u2019t here just to play nice. The UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority update their guidelines every year, and cybersecurity is one of their top priorities to protect bettors and prevent money laundering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, they are forcing bookies and gambling companies to invest in cybersecurity measures. But what if bookies deny? Well, non-compliance risks license loss, which means that the bookie won\u2019t be operational anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movement inspired cybersecurity investments like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imperva.com\/learn\/data-security\/soc-2-compliance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SOC 2-certified platforms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, just to prove you\u2019re legit, and other innovations that make sure such hack attacks happen as rarely as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Trust<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is safe to say that the bookie&#8217;s biggest loss after a hack attack is in reputation. Nobody touches a bookie they don\u2019t trust, and if you know that a sports betting website was recently hacked, would you make an account? Of course not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of money here cannot be measured, but their ruined reputation can put bookies out of business really fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cost of Doing Nothing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skimp on cybersecurity, and you\u2019re rolling dice with your business. The 2024 average breach cost ($4.88 million) is no joke\u2014small bookies could fold under that. I verified this with McKinsey\u2019s 2022 report, which pegs cybercrime costs at $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downtime\u2019s brutal too; a crashed app during a major race loses 5-10% of daily revenue. Regulators can suspend licenses, as seen with Matchbook\u2019s 2020 UK ban,\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even big players aren\u2019t immune. A 2024 SEC case fined four firms $990,000-$4 million for misleading post-breach disclosures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smaller bookies, with tighter margins, can\u2019t afford these hits. Investing upfront\u2014$10,000-$100,000 for robust systems\u2014beats paying millions later. It\u2019s like buying insurance before the storm, not after your roof\u2019s gone.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Get Started?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to armor up? Start small but smart. Encrypt data with tools like AWS Key Management ($1\/key\/month). Roll out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/security\/business\/identity-access\/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MFA across your platform<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014Okta\u2019s free for basic setups. Hire a cybersecurity consultant ($100-$300\/hour) to audit your systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor threats with real-time tools\u2014Datadog ($15\/user\/month), tracks system anomalies. Stay compliant with GDPR and Gambling Commission rules; a lawyer ($2,000-$5,000) can review your policies. Test your defenses yearly\u2014penetration tests catch 95% of vulnerabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the situation is very serious, and it will get even more difficult from here. That\u2019s why bookies need to devote a portion of their profits to cybersecurity improvements.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why Bookies Need to Invest In Cybersecurity &#8211; It is no secret that cybercrime is rising and hackers are coming up with unique ways that make even big sports betting organizations fall to their knees.
