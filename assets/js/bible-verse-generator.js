As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.","  The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?","  Don\u2019t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it.","  Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face forever more.","  There are six things which Yahweh hates. Yes, seven which are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.","  Then if any man tells you, \u2018Behold, here is the Christ,\u2019 or, \u2018There,\u2019 don\u2019t believe it. For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.","  Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.","  Commit your deeds to the Lord and your plans shall succeed.","  Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.","  May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.","  Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.","  Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen.","  I sought The Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.","  For God didn\u2019t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.","  There will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.","  We put bits into the horses\u2019 mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body. The ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires. So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest! And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.","  For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; while we don\u2019t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.","  Haven\u2019t I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don\u2019t be afraid. Don\u2019t be dismayed, for The Lord your God is with you wherever you go.","  He who conceals his sins doesn\u2019t prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.","  One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm.","  Love is patient and is kind; love doesn\u2019t envy. Love doesn\u2019t brag, is not proud, doesn\u2019t behave itself inappropriately, doesn\u2019t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn\u2019t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.","  No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.","  Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine.","  Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall. But those who wait for The Lord will renew their strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run, and not be weary. They will walk, and not faint.","  For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.","  What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?","  The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.","  And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.","  If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. The stranger who lives as a foreigner with you shall be to you as the native-born among you, and you shall love him as yourself.","  Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.","  God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?","  If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.","  Cast your burden on The Lord, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved. But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.","  The fear of Lord is the beginning of wisdom. All those who do his work have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.","  Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically. Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying.","  Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you.","  Make no friendship with a man given to anger, nor go with a wrathful man, lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.","  Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.","  Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.","  For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.","  I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God&#8217;s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God \u2013 this is true worship.","  Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.","  Understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.","  If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself; each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.","  My flesh and my heart fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.","  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.","  Don\u2019t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.","  Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don\u2019t know.","  Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.","  Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u201d","  For I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.","  The Lord will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble. Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Oh Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you.","  I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.","  The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.","  He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.","  But The Lord said to Samuel, \u201cDon\u2019t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don\u2019t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but The Lord looks at the heart.\u201d","  But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.","  Therefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.","  I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well.","  Don\u2019t judge, and you won\u2019t be judged. Don\u2019t condemn, and you won\u2019t be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.","  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.","  Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don\u2019t curse.","  Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.","  We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who[a] have been called according to his purpose.","  And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.","  Let us, therefore, draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.","  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.","  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.","  Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father\u2019s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don\u2019t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.","  Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth.","  For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.","  Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.","  Blessed is the man who trusts in The Lord, whose confidence is in him. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.","  Don\u2019t you be afraid, for I am with you. Don\u2019t be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you. Yes, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.","  The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.","  When your will is God&#8217;s will, you will have your will.","  If you can&#8217;t fly then run, if you can&#8217;t run then walk, if you can&#8217;t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.","  Refuse to be average. Let your heart soar as high as it will.","  Let God have your life; He can do more with it than you can.","  When God makes a promise, faith believes it, hope anticipates it, and patience quietly awaits it.","  We gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face&#8230;we must do that which we think we cannot.","  Strength is gained in the struggle! We have to learn to stop being afraid of difficult things.","  Prayer is the acid test of the inner man&#8217;s strength. A strong spirit is capable of praying much and praying with all perseverance until the answer comes. A weak one grows weary and fainthearted in the maintenance of praying.","  God loves to take people who start with the odds against them and cause them to do extraordinary things.","  God is able to accomplish, provide, help, save, keep, subdue&#8230; He is able to do what you can&#8217;t. He already has a plan. God&#8217;s not bewildered. Go to Him.","  No man &#8211; I don&#8217;t care how colossal his intellect &#8211; No man is greater than his prayer life.","  If you don&#8217;t feel strong desires for the manifestation of the glory of God, it is not because you have drunk deeply and are satisfied. It is because you have nibbled so long at the table of the world. Your soul is stuffed with small things, and there is no room for the great.","  Your words will tell others what you think. Your actions will tell them what you believe.","  Our greatest fear should not be of failure but of succeeding at things in life that don\u2019t really matter.","  Be a person that&#8217;s full of hope. Hope is a positive expectation, a joyful expectation, that something good is going to happen to you!","  Faith is taking the first step even when you can&#8217;t see the whole staircase.","  There\u2019s nothing you can do to make God love you any more or any less. It\u2019s a gift. Just receive it.","  You cannot really have the world and hold on to it. It is all too temporary and the more you try to hold on to it, the more it actually holds you. By contrast, the more you hold on to the true and the good, the more you are free to really live.","  When you understand that life is a test, you realize that nothing is insignificant in your life.","  He who lays up treasures on earth spends his life backing away from his treasures. To him, death is loss. He who lays up treasures in heaven looks forward to eternity; he\u2019s moving daily toward his treasures. To him, death is gain.","  All our difficulties are only platforms for the manifestations of His grace, power and love.","  The will of God will not take us where the grace of God cannot sustain us.","  If you can&#8217;t figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will lead you right into your purpose.","  Remember who you are. Don\u2019t compromise for anyone, for any reason. You are a child of the Almighty God. Live that truth.","  The day of judgment will be a day when the skeletons come out of the closets! And each of us will be standing there to face the record.","  You can be at peace with your past, content with your present and sure about your future, knowing that God loves you!","  Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows; it empties today of its strength.","  It\u2019s freeing when you realize you don\u2019t have to prove anything. Some of the people you\u2019re trying to outperform aren\u2019t even watching.","  The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, &#8216;O God, forgive me,&#8217; or &#8216;Help me.","  When God has a plan for your life, I don\u2019t care how much you murmur and complain and kick and fuss and scream and yell. When you know that God has a plan for your life, He got you tied up. He\u2019s not gonna let you get away. He\u2019ll say, Be still and see the salvation of the Lord.","  Do you want to experience God&#8217;s supernatural power? Stop complaining about your situation &amp; start giving thanks for His miraculous answers.","  Remember in the darkness what God told you in the light."];$(".btn-primary").click(function(){var select=$('#bible_search_select option:selected').val();var months=random_elems(some_array,some_array1,select);});var select=$('#bible_search_select option:selected').val();var months=random_elems(some_array,some_array1,select);function random_elems(arr,arr1,count){var base_url=$("#base_url_data").data("base_url");var li="";var len=arr.length;var len1=arr1.length;var lookup={};var tmp=[];if(count>len)count=len;for(var i=0;i<count;i++){var index;do{index=~~(Math.random()*len);}while(index in lookup);lookup[index]=null;tmp.push(arr[index]);li+='<div class=" xs-12 sm-9 md-6 align-center"><div class="verse-wrap"><div class="verse"><img class="verse_img" src="'+base_url+'/assets/images/bible_images/verse_img1.jpg" alt="img"><div class="verse-content"><h5 class="verse-title">'+arr[index]+'</h5><p>'+arr1[index]+'</p><button data-bible_verse="'+arr[index]+'\n'+arr1[index]+'" tooltip="click to copy" tooltip-position="top" class="btn-toggel btn_copy btn btn-primary">Copy</button></div></div></div></div>'}$('.bible-vers-result').html(li);return tmp;}$(document).ready(function(){$(document).on("click",".btn_copy",function(){var copyText=$(this).data('bible_verse');var textArea=document.createElement("textarea");textArea.value=copyText;document.body.appendChild(textArea);textArea.select();document.execCommand("Copy");textArea.remove();$(this).attr('tooltip','copied');});$('.btn_copy').on('mouseleave',function(event){$(this).attr('tooltip','click to copy');});$(".copy-btn").click(function(){$(".copied-toggle").fadeIn(1000).fadeOut(1000);});});;
